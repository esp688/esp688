### Hey there, I'm Sammy 👋🏾

I'm new to software development and at times it can be overwhelming and intimidating, but I'm eager to take on the challenge and learn. I am open to learning through trial and error, recognizing that making mistakes is a necessary step in the process of growth.

I believe that technology has the power to address many problems, particularly for small businesses. I also have a deep desire to give a helping hand to diverse communities that may not have the same opportunities as me.

I am looking to be part of a work culture that encourages mentorship, where I can improve my coding skills and also be a great team player. Please reach out if you would like to chat or if you need any help.. 😀
