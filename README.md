### Hey there, I'm Sammy 👋🏾

I'm new too the software development. I have quickly relasied that at times it can be overwhleming and intimidating, but I'm eager to take on the challenge and learn. I am open to learning through trial and error, recognizing that making mistakes is a necessary step in the process for growth.

I believe technology has the power to address many problems, particulary for small business. I also have an deep desire to give a helping hand too diverse communities that may not have the opportunties that has been given to me. 

I am looking to be part of a work culture encourages mentorship where i can improve my coding skills and also be a great team player. 
Please reach out if you would like to chat or if you would like some help. 😀
